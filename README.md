# Zwimato - Food Delivery Website

This is a simple, non-functional front-end clone of a food delivery service website, inspired by Swiggy. It's built with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

## Features

  * **Homepage**: A welcoming homepage with a search bar for finding restaurants and food items.
  * **Search Functionality**: Users can input their delivery location and a search query to find what they're looking for. The search is not functional but the UI is in place.
  * **Visually Appealing Design**: The website has a clean and modern design with images and styled buttons.
  * **Partner with us page**: A separate page for restaurants or businesses who want to partner with the service.
